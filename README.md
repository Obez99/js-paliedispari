# Pali e Dispari

**Description**:<br>
For this repository I made two scripts: **Palindroma** and **Pari e dispari**.<br>

## Palindroma
This script checks if the word inside the input box is palindrome.

## Pari e Dispari
This script makes the user guess if the final number should be **even** or **odd**, then asks for a number between 1 and 5 via prompt.<br>
After validating these two values, another function generates a random number for the ai.<br>
The user will win if the sum of his number and the ai's number is equal to his initial guess.
